# Capstone Project
Sixth and last course of the specialization

Final project of this specialization consists of creating a binary classification model for churn prediction. Provided dataset is taken from KDD Cup 2009 and represents data of clients of Orange France. There are several problems in this modelization:

- data is anonymous, names of all features are deleted, categories are changed for categorical features
- a lot of missing values (around 75% or even more)
- classes are unbalanced, 92.5% are loyal
